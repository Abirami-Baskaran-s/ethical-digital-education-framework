Strategic IS Plan Proposal

Implementing a user friendly system for student records, attendance, reporting, and international student services, featuring interactive modules, e-badges, and performance dashboards. Developing  data analytics for live reports to track student achievement, engagement, retention, analyze equity gaps (Māori, Pasifika, disabilities), and measure graduate outcomes.Additionally making a Risk matrix . Providing staff with prior training about the usage and online teaching to mitigate risks and support teachers with smooth transition.
Making available resources of prerecorded videos for the international and domestic students to understand code of conduct , the college systems and how to access resources online. Onboarding is one of the major step , it has to be creative and innovative for the students to start their journey in college , setting flexible enrollment rules can help the student to relax and concentrate on studies (international students when Visa is delayed or rejected)

Cultural, Ethical & Risk Considerations

Yoobee Colleges main importance is to give importance to the teTe Tiriti o Waitangi  and ethical data practices , especially Māori Data Sovereignty . The new platform given in the report would empower not only Maori students but also students from different ethnicities making them feel valued and capable . By contributing to Māori data sovereignty principles: Tino Rangatiratanga (Self-Determination), Whanaungatanga (Relationships), Manaakitanga (Care and Respect), and Kaitiakitanga (Guardianship) we can create space for cultural engagment. 

NZQA Compliance & Ethical Data Use

The proposed Information System (IS) will invest considerable emphasis on good data governance and security, adhering to NZQA regulations and ethical guidelines. This commitment will underpin the students' privacy of data and furnish students a means of being aware of the data which is being used. The system will also standardise moderation and assessment within/from templates and automated checklists, and directly deal with the "serious flaws" identified by NZQA that the current system suffers from, in order to refine operational internal moderation processes. The proposed system will have a module dedicated to an academic risk register to keep track of the risks of low achievement, operational staff turnover 

Conclusion
Mā te rongo, ka mōhio. - Through perception, comes awareness.
Mā te mōhio, ka mārama.- Through awareness, comes understanding.
Mā te mārama, ka mātau.- Through understanding, comes wisdom.
Mā te mātau, ka ora. - Through wisdom, comes well-being.

Yoobee College's legacy, disjointed systems and various online teaching and learning styles prevent it from achieving its strategic goals and hinders data-based self-evaluation, despite being well-supported by students. A proposed strategic IS plan with a holistic student and learning platform and digital-first training for staff will consolidate data seamlessly while delivering an automated and auditable process that meets NZQA compliance, elevating Yoobee College as a leader in equitable education in Aotearoa.
