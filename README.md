# Strategic-IS-Plan-for-Yoobee-College
This project involved developing a Strategic Information Systems Plan (SISP) for Yoobee College to address a fragmented and outdated IS landscape. The plan focused on replacing legacy, manual processes with integrated, cloud-based Student Management (SMS) and Learning Management (LMS) systems.
